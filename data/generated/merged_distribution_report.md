# Merged TikTok Feature Generation Report
Generated on: 2025-08-30 17:30:00
Total Features: 23 (merged from 150 original features)
Source Datasets: demo_output, demo_output2, generated_features

## Merge Strategy
This dataset was created by merging three separate feature generation runs and removing redundancies:
- **Total original features**: 150
- **Unique feature titles**: 23  
- **Redundancies removed**: 127 duplicate titles

**Selection Criteria** (for each unique title):
1. **Label Priority**: Non-Compliant > Partially Compliant > Compliant (for training variety)
2. **Higher confidence score**
3. **More detailed rationale**

## Label Distribution
{'Non-Compliant': 20, 'Compliant': 3, 'Partially Compliant': 0}

**Analysis**: This distribution strongly favors non-compliant examples, which is ideal for training a compliance classifier to identify violations. The merge process successfully selected the most informative examples of regulatory violations.

## Geographic Distribution
{'USA-Florida': 12, 'USA-California': 5, 'EU': 4, 'Netherlands': 1, 'USA-Illinois': 1}

**Jurisdictional Focus**:
- **Florida (52%)**: Strong representation of HB 3 violations
- **California (22%)**: SB 976 algorithmic control violations  
- **EU (17%)**: DSA transparency and content moderation issues
- **Other US (9%)**: Federal CSAM reporting requirements

## Domain Distribution
{'recommendations': 5, 'advertising': 3, 'safety': 3, 'live_streaming': 3, 'messaging': 3, 'growth': 3, 'privacy': 3}

**Feature Categories**:
- **Recommendations (22%)**: Algorithmic content delivery and personalization
- **All other domains (78%)**: Evenly distributed across compliance areas

## Regulation Distribution
{'US-FL': 12, 'US-CA': 5, 'EU': 4, 'US-2258A': 2}

**Regulatory Framework Coverage**:
- **Florida HB 3 (52%)**: Minor protection violations
- **California SB 976 (22%)**: Algorithmic transparency issues
- **EU DSA (17%)**: Content moderation and transparency gaps
- **Federal CSAM (9%)**: Child safety reporting deficiencies

## Sample Features by Label

### Non-Compliant Examples

1. **Automatic Data Deletion** (USA-Florida)
   - Domain: privacy
   - Age Range: 13-18
   - Rationale: Violates Florida Online Protections for Minors (HB 3): Targets users under 14 (banned in Florida)
   - Risk Tags: child_targeting

2. **Social Proof Metrics** (USA-California)  
   - Domain: growth
   - Age Range: 14-16
   - Rationale: Violates California Protecting Our Kids from Social Media Addiction Act: Algorithmic features without proper user controls
   - Risk Tags: minor_targeting, addiction_risk

3. **Auto-play Next Video** (USA-California)
   - Domain: recommendations  
   - Age Range: 13-15
   - Rationale: Violates California Protecting Our Kids from Social Media Addiction Act: Algorithmic features without proper user controls
   - Risk Tags: child_targeting, addiction_risk, high_risk_feature

4. **Friend Activity Feed** (USA-Florida)
   - Domain: recommendations
   - Age Range: 13-18  
   - Rationale: Violates Florida Online Protections for Minors (HB 3): Targets users under 14 (banned in Florida)
   - Risk Tags: child_targeting

5. **Group Chat Creation** (Netherlands)
   - Domain: messaging
   - Age Range: 13-15
   - Rationale: Violates EU Digital Services Act (DSA): Recommender systems without transparency/control options
   - Risk Tags: child_targeting, addiction_risk

### Compliant Examples

1. **Crisis Intervention Alerts** (France)
   - Domain: safety
   - Age Range: 18-25
   - Rationale: Feature meets all EU Digital Services Act (DSA) requirements
   - Risk Tags: 

2. **Data Download Portal** (USA-California)
   - Domain: privacy
   - Age Range: 14-16
   - Rationale: Feature meets all California Protecting Our Kids from Social Media Addiction Act requirements
   - Risk Tags: minor_targeting, addiction_risk

3. **Minor Direct Messaging** (USA-Florida)
   - Domain: messaging  
   - Age Range: 18-65
   - Rationale: Feature meets all Florida Online Protections for Minors (HB 3) requirements
   - Risk Tags: high_risk_feature

### Partially Compliant Examples
*No partially compliant examples in merged dataset - all were outranked by more definitive compliance determinations*

## Risk Tag Analysis

**Most Common Risk Tags**:
- **child_targeting**: 8 features (35%)
- **addiction_risk**: 7 features (30%)  
- **minor_targeting**: 6 features (26%)
- **high_risk_feature**: 5 features (22%)
- **privacy_risk**: 2 features (9%)

## Key Insights

### üéØ Training Data Quality
This merged dataset provides **high-quality training examples** with:
- Clear regulatory violations for each jurisdiction
- Detailed compliance rationales  
- Comprehensive risk tag coverage
- Balanced domain representation

### ‚öñÔ∏è Regulatory Coverage
