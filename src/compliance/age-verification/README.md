# Age Verification System for Social Media Compliance

## Overview
This module implements comprehensive age verification systems to comply with jurisdiction-specific requirements including Florida HB 3, California SB 976, COPPA, and EU regulations.

## Components

### Core Age Verification Engine
- **Document Verification**: Government-issued ID processing and validation
- **Biometric Age Estimation**: Optional facial analysis for age approximation
- **Third-Party Integration**: Integration with verified age verification services
- **Progressive Verification**: Escalating verification based on feature access requirements

### Jurisdiction-Specific Implementations
- **Florida HB 3**: Complete prohibition under 14, parental consent for 14-15
- **COPPA**: Verified parental consent for under 13
- **California SB 976**: Enhanced protections with parental oversight
- **EU**: Age of digital consent compliance (13-16 depending on member state)

## Technical Architecture

```python
# Core age verification interface
class AgeVerificationEngine:
    def verify_age(self, verification_data: Dict, jurisdiction: str) -> AgeVerificationResult
    def get_age_requirements(self, jurisdiction: str, feature: str) -> AgeRequirement
    def validate_parental_consent(self, consent_data: Dict) -> ConsentValidationResult
    def handle_age_transition(self, user_id: str, new_age: int) -> None
```

### Integration Points
- **Account Creation Flow**: Age verification during registration
- **Feature Access Control**: Real-time age checks for restricted features
- **Parental Consent Management**: Streamlined parent approval workflows
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive verification attempt tracking

## Implementation Status

### Completed Components âœ…
- Configuration schema for jurisdiction-specific age requirements
- Basic age verification workflow design
- Audit logging framework for verification attempts

### In Progress Components ðŸ”„
- Document verification processing pipeline
- Biometric age estimation integration
- Parental consent collection mechanisms

### Planned Components ðŸ“‹
- Third-party verification service integrations
- Progressive verification for feature access
- Cross-platform age verification consistency
- Fraud detection and anti-spoofing measures

## Configuration Example

```yaml
# config/age-thresholds/jurisdiction-overrides.yaml
age_verification:
  florida_hb3:
    minimum_age: 14
    prohibited_under: 14
    parental_consent_required: [14, 15]
    verification_methods: ["government_id", "credit_card", "third_party"]
    
  coppa:
    minimum_age: 13
    parental_consent_required: [0, 12]
    verified_consent_required: true
    consent_methods: ["digital_signature", "credit_card", "government_id"]
```

## Testing & Validation

- **Unit Tests**: Individual component functionality
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end age verification flows
- **Compliance Tests**: Jurisdiction-specific requirement validation
- **Security Tests**: Anti-fraud and spoofing detection
- **Performance Tests**: Verification speed and accuracy metrics

## Next Steps

1. Implement document verification pipeline with OCR and validation
2. Integrate biometric age estimation services
3. Build comprehensive parental consent collection system
4. Develop fraud detection and anti-spoofing capabilities
5. Create user-friendly verification interfaces for all supported methods
