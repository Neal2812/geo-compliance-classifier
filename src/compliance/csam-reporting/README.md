# CSAM Detection and Reporting System

## Overview
This module implements Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) detection and reporting capabilities to comply with US Federal reporting requirements (18 U.S.C. Â§2258A) and international child safety obligations.

## Components

### Detection Systems
- **Hash Matching**: PhotoDNA and custom hash database matching
- **Machine Learning Detection**: AI-powered visual content analysis
- **Metadata Analysis**: EXIF data and file characteristic analysis
- **Behavioral Pattern Detection**: User behavior analysis for CSAM indicators

### Reporting Infrastructure
- **NCMEC Reporting**: Automated reporting to National Center for Missing & Exploited Children
- **Law Enforcement Coordination**: Secure reporting channels to authorities
- **Evidence Preservation**: Secure storage and chain of custody maintenance
- **International Reporting**: Coordination with international child safety organizations

## Technical Architecture

```python
# Core CSAM detection interface
class CSAMDetectionEngine:
    def scan_content(self, content: ContentItem) -> DetectionResult
    def report_violation(self, detection: DetectionResult) -> ReportingResult
    def preserve_evidence(self, content_id: str, detection_data: Dict) -> PreservationResult
    def coordinate_with_authorities(self, report_id: str) -> CoordinationResult
```

### Detection Pipeline
1. **Content Ingestion**: Real-time content processing as uploaded
2. **Multi-Modal Analysis**: Image, video, text, and metadata analysis
3. **Risk Scoring**: Confidence-based classification of potential CSAM
4. **Human Review**: Expert review for high-confidence detections
5. **Automated Reporting**: Immediate reporting for confirmed violations

## Compliance Requirements

### US Federal (18 U.S.C. Â§2258A)
- **Immediate Reporting**: Report apparent CSAM to NCMEC within 24 hours
- **Evidence Preservation**: Maintain evidence for 90 days minimum
- **Cooperation with Authorities**: Provide access to law enforcement
- **User Privacy Protection**: Balance reporting with privacy obligations

### International Obligations
- **EU DSA**: Priority content moderation for child safety
- **UK Online Safety Act**: Proactive CSAM detection requirements
- **Canadian Child Protection**: Reporting to Canadian authorities
- **Global Best Practices**: Industry-leading detection and response

## Implementation Status

- Expert reviewer training and workflows
- International reporting coordination
- Advanced behavioral pattern detection

## Security & Privacy Considerations

### Evidence Security
- **Encrypted Storage**: All evidence stored with end-to-end encryption
- **Access Controls**: Strict role-based access to CSAM evidence
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive access and action logging
- **Secure Transmission**: Encrypted reporting to authorities

### Privacy Protection
- **Minimal Data Collection**: Only necessary data for detection and reporting
- **User Notification**: Appropriate user notification of account actions
- **Data Retention Limits**: Automatic deletion per regulatory requirements
- **False Positive Handling**: Secure handling of incorrectly flagged content

## Performance Metrics

### Detection Accuracy
- **True Positive Rate**: Percentage of actual CSAM correctly identified
- **False Positive Rate**: Percentage of legitimate content incorrectly flagged
- **Processing Speed**: Average time from upload to detection result
- **Human Review Accuracy**: Expert reviewer agreement rates

### Reporting Compliance
- **Reporting Timeliness**: Time from detection to NCMEC report submission
- **Evidence Preservation**: Successful evidence retention and access
- **Authority Cooperation**: Response time to law enforcement requests
- **Cross-Border Coordination**: International reporting success rates

## Integration Points

### Content Moderation
- Integration with general content moderation workflows
- Priority handling for child safety content
- Coordination with human review teams
- Appeal and false positive correction processes

### User Safety Systems
- Integration with user reporting mechanisms
- Coordination with account safety actions
- Integration with parental control systems
- User education and resource provision

## Testing & Validation

### Functional Testing
- **Detection Accuracy Testing**: Controlled testing with known datasets
- **Reporting Integration Testing**: End-to-end reporting workflow validation
- **Evidence Preservation Testing**: Data integrity and accessibility validation
- **Security Testing**: Encryption and access control validation

### Compliance Validation
- **Regulatory Requirement Testing**: Specific compliance obligation verification
- **Timing Requirement Testing**: Reporting deadline compliance validation
- **Authority Coordination Testing**: Communication channel validation
- **Privacy Compliance Testing**: Data handling and retention validation
