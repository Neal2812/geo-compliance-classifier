# Human Reviews Directory

This directory stores human review requests generated by the MCP server when the compliance analysis system requires human input.

## File Structure

Each review request is stored as a JSON file with the following structure:

```json
{
  "id": "review_timestamp_randomid",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-31T12:00:00.000Z",
  "reason": "low_confidence|abstain|conflict|edge_case",
  "priority": "low|medium|high|urgent",
  "status": "pending|completed",
  "context": {
    "feature_data": { /* Original feature data */ },
    "jurisdiction": "EU",
    "analysis_result": { /* AI analysis result */ }
  },
  "human_decision": {
    "verdict": "COMPLIANT|NON_COMPLIANT|NEEDS_MODIFICATION",
    "confidence": 0.9,
    "reasoning": "Human reviewer explanation",
    "reviewer": "human_reviewer",
    "timestamp": "2025-08-31T12:05:00.000Z"
  },
  "reviewed_at": "2025-08-31T12:05:00.000Z"
}
```
